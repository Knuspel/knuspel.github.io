# Linkin Park
I am supposed to tell you a story about my favourite character. But I don't really have one.
I'll tell you about Linkin Park. A Band that followed me throughout my youth and always captured what I was feeling.
Their first album was called "Hybrid Theory" and already contained titles like Numb, that are still recognizable and great today.
